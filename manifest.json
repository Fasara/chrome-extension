//"split" will allow the extension to run in its own process when the browser is incognito//
// chrome_url_overrides => tells chrome to open index.html whenever a new tab is opened
//The value of "permissions" will give the user a pop-up letting them know that this extension will override their new tab when they try to install it
//weâ€™re telling Chrome what to display as our favicon: a file called icon.png, which will be 128 x 128 pixels
